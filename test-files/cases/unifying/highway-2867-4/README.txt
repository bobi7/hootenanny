The road named Naseemee Hingun in the secondary dataset should have its tags transferred over to the corresponding reference feature that doesn't have any tags, and the geometry of the reference feature should be preserved with no splits.  The nearby roads named Miriyas Magu and Dhakandhaa Magu should contain splits because that reference road data had its geometry extended by features in the secondary dataset.
